# MulthiThreaded-Server
MultiThreaded Server is a simple mini multithreaded server practise Project 
 which is built in java that can handle multiple clients simultaneously.

# Concept
This project is a simple multithreaded server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously. 
It is built in Java and demonstrates the use of threads to manage client connections.
It uses sockets to communicate with clients and can handle multiple requests at the same time.
This project is a good example of how to use threads in Java to create a multithreaded server.
It uses the Java Socket API to create a server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously.
And it uses the Java Thread API to create a thread for each client that connects to the server.

# How to run
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd MultiThreaded-Server
3. Compile the Java files
   ```bash
    javac Server.java Client.java
4. Run the server
5. ```bash
   java Server
6. Run the client
   ```bash
    java Client
7. Open multiple terminal windows and run the client in each window
# Features
- Handles multiple clients simultaneously using threads.
- Uses sockets for communication between server and clients.
- Demonstrates basic multithreading concepts in Java.

# Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Java programming and multithreading concepts.
- A terminal or command prompt to run the server and client applications.
- A text editor or IDE to modify the code if needed.
- Network connectivity to test the server and client communication.
